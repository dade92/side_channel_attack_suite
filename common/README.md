    Helper classes for the most common dpacalc operations:
    Input class loads the traces from HDD to main memory,
    Output class stores traces from memory to HDD,
    Math.hpp instead contains some useful functions to compute
    for instance the mean of some traces, gaussian approximation
    etc..
